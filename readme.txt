Merchants who have a WordPress e-commerce store are notified of new orders via a text message to their mobile phone through Clockwork.

== Description ==

This plugin integrates [Shopp](http://shopplugin.net) with [Clockwork](http://www.clockworksms.com).

This plugin adds text message notifications for new orders.

After checkout, the merchant will receive a text message with new order information.

This process occurs in the background without needing action from the customer.
